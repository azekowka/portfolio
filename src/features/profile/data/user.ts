Hey there 👋 I am Abdulaziz Gabitov — an AI Software Engineer passionate about creating high-performance, AI-centric software solutions with intuitive and engaging designs.

With 3+ years of experience, I specialize in building high-quality web and mobile applications using Next.js, React, TypeScript, Python, and modern full stack technologies. Beyond work, I love playing football, exercising in the gym, inspiring from [YCombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies) startup directory.
